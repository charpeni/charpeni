### Hi there 👋

I'm mainly playing with React Native, React, GraphQL, and various Continuous Integrations. I'm an open-source enthusiast (of course!), and I enjoy removing friction from the developer experience. I often describe myself as someone doing the "backend" work of the frontend: frontend architecture and infrastructure. ⚙️ Probably working on the next tool or library to improve your day-to-day.
